/*
	Challenge 9: Return a Boolean if a number is divisible by 10

			Here, you'll create a function that'll give you a "true" or "false"
			Boolean as its output. The inputted number should only return a "true" if
			it's divisible by 10. Otherwise, your program should return a "false"
			answer.
 */

// you can log out to the console or to the output container like this:
// output.innerText = "My output";
const output = document.getElementById("output-container");
if (!output) throw "Output container not found.";

//@ts-check
// your code starts after this line
