		<h1>Print all even numbers from 0 – 10</h1>
		<p>
			Try to make the solution to this problem as efficiently as possible.
			Consider using loops that would allow you to type the fewest
			characters/commands. While you could simply print the even numbers, get
			creative and see how you could output them in a way that would work up to
			10 or even up to 10,000 with little extra effort.
