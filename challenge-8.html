		<h1>Remove the spaces found in a string</h1>
		<p>
			Yet another way to clean up data is to remove any errors or unnecessary
			spaces. This function will take in a string and then return it with all
			spaces removed. Think about if you were tasked with cleaning up customer
			data at your job. You could scale this function to clean up specific
			fields of data, such as zip codes.
