		<h1>Calculate the sum of numbers within an array</h1>
		<p>
			You can create your own array of numbers but consider trying this problem
			with a few different sets to verify your solution. Have one array with
			negative and positive numbers and another with integers and decimals.
		</p>
		<p>
			You could also try using arrays of different lengths. If you're feeling
			comfortable with this, try the slightly more challenging bonus challenge
			below.
		</p>
		<p>
			Bonus intermediate challenge: Create a function that can return the sum of
			a particular column or row number in a table.
