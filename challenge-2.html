		<h1>Print a table containing multiplication tables</h1>
		<p>
			Let's start with the tables that many of us had to memorize in school. Can
			you print a table that contains all the answers to the multiplication
			tables from 1 through 10?
		</p>

			easily expand should you need the 12 times table?
